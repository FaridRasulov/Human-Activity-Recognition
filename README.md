We are going to divide our data to train and test sets. Data will be separated in proportion 70% (as trainig data) and 30% (as test data) All the data collected you can find in Data archive. The files are in csv format. The name of the file defines the type of activity. Each file is divided into several columns where each column consits of readings from one sensor (the first column is for time).
